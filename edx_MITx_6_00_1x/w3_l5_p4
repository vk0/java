The greatest common divisor of two positive integers is the largest integer that divides each of them without remainder. For example,

    gcd(2, 12) = 2

    gcd(6, 12) = 6

    gcd(9, 12) = 3

    gcd(17, 12) = 1

Write an iterative function, gcdIter(a, b), that implements this idea. One easy way to do this is to begin with a test value equal to the smaller of the two input arguments, and iteratively reduce this test value by 1 until you either reach a case where the test divides both a and b without remainder, or you reach 1.

def gcdIter(a, b):
    '''
    a, b: positive integers

    returns: a positive integer, the greatest common divisor of a & b.
    '''
    # Your code here
    if a <= b:
        sm_int = a
    else:
        sm_int = b
    for i in range(sm_int,0,-1):
        if i == 1:
            return 1
        elif a % i == 0 and b % i == 0:
            return i
