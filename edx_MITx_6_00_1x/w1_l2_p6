For each of the following expressions, indicate the value returned, or if the evaluation would lead to an error, write the word 'error' (note this is a word, not a string). While you could simply type these expressions into an Idle shell, we encourage you to answer them directly since this will help reinforce your understanding of basic Python expressions.

"a" + "bc"
abc

3 * "bc"
bcbcbc

"3" * "bc"
error

"abcd"[2]
c

"abcd"[0:2]
ab

"abcd"[:2]
ab

"abcd"[2:]
cd
