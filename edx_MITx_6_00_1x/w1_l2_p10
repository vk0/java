Write a piece of Python code that prints out the string 'hello world' if the value of an integer variable, happy, is strictly greater than 2.

For problems such as these, do not include raw_input statements or define the variable happy in any way. Our automated testing will provide a value of happy for you - so write your code in the following box assuming happy is already defined.


if happy > 2:
    print "hello world"
